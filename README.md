# DEX

This is my solution to [Speed Run Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/)'s Build a DEX Challenge.

This challenge is about building/understanding a simple decentralized exchange, with one token-pair (ERC20 BALLOONS ($BAL) and ETH).

Read about the challenge and code at the repo of the challenge here: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-challenges/tree/challenge-4-dex
